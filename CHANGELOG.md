# Changelog

## 0.4.1 (2015-05-11)
* Fixed two issues with `urlFormat` and `urlQuotes` where they would incorrectly report errors when the URLs were surrounded by spaces ([#22](https://github.com/jwilsson/lesshint/issues/22)).

## 0.4.0 (2015-05-10)
* **Breaking change:** The `LessHint` class is now called `Lesshint`.
* The following linters have been added:
    * `importantRule`
    * `stringQuotes`
    * `urlFormat`
    * `urlQuotes`
* All linters can now be disabled by simply setting the respective property to `false`. No need to set `enabled: false` anymore.
* Some other improvements to the linters.

## 0.3.1 (2015-05-03)
* When running from the CLI and a line or column is `null`, it's no longer printed.
* Fixed an issue where the only error reported was a missing final newline.
* Fixed an issue that prevented errors on the last ruleset from being shown when a final newline was missing.
* Fixed an issue where `emptyRule` would incorrectly report errors on rules that only contain a mixin ([#16](https://github.com/jwilsson/lesshint/issues/16)).
* Fixed an issue where `trailingSemicolon` would fail on an empty rule.
* Fixed an issue where `trailingSemicolon` would incorrectly report errors in rules containing variables inside `@media` directives ([#15](https://github.com/jwilsson/lesshint/issues/15)).

## 0.3.0 (2015-05-01)
* Added the following linters:
    * `duplicateProperty`
    * `emptyRule`
    * `finalNewline`
    * `idSelector`
    * `trailingSemicolon`
* Better error messages, the property or value that caused the error are now more clearly described.
* Internal code cleanup.

## 0.2.0 (2015-04-27)
* Added the following linters:
    * `borderZero`
    * `hexLength`
    * `hexNotation`
    * `hexValidation`
    * `spaceAfterPropertyName`
* `lesshint` will now exit with proper status codes. E.g. `1` when there's a lint error in a checked file, thus failing builds etc.
* Made some improvements to CLI output, added colors and made it easier to read.
* Fixed an issue where the `spaceBeforeBrace` linter would report the wrong column when `style` is `one_space` ([`#4`](https://github.com/jwilsson/lesshint/issues/4)).

## 0.1.5 (2015-04-24)
* The default options are now always loaded, regardless if `lesshint` is running from the CLI or another module.
* If no files are passed via the CLI, an error is now printed.
