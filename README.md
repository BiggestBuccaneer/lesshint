# lesshint

`lesshint` is a tool to aid you in writing clean and consistent [Less](http://lesscss.org/).

## Important information
Since this is the final project for a associate degree pull requests cannot be accepted until mid-June 2015.

However, this project will employ the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
Basically, this means that all code will be written by me ([jwilsson](https://github.com/jwilsson))
but all linter options (available settings, default values etc.) and other features
will be submitted as issues/pull requests and are subject to discussion with the community before merging.

And of course, bug reports and feedback is greatly appreciated!
