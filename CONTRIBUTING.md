# Contributing

## Issues
Please submit all your bug reports, feature requests and pull requests here but note that this isn't the place for support requests. Please use [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) for this.

## Bug reports
1. Search the issues, has it already been reported?
2. Download the latest source, did this solve the problem?
4. If the answer to all of the above questions are "No" then open a bug report and include the following:
    * A short, descriptive title.
    * A quick summary of the problem.
    * Example code! Nothing helps as much as some Less code that's failing.
    * Possible solutions or other relevant information/suggestions.

## Pull requests
If you have an idea for a new linter or a new feature, please file an issue first to see if it fits the scope of this project.
That way no one's time needs to be wasted.

All bug fixes and new features are must be accompanied by tests.
See the `tests` directory for some examples and run `npm test` before committing to ensure everything passes and the code style is consistent.
